# Reliant AI

## Description

- The application showcases a collection of products within an AGGrid Table component. Certain cells within the `Total Reviews Count` column may contain alternative values, which will be distinguished with a pale yellow highlighting. Additionally, the initial cell for review will feature a red border to draw attention.
- Upon clicking the `Split Row` button, the current row marked with the red border will generate new entries based on the available alternate values.
